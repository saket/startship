# startship

![demo](demo.gif)

```shell script
$ brew install saket/repo/startship
$
$ cd ~/path/to/your/library/project
$ startship release && say "released"
```

`startship` makes the process of releasing JVM libraries _a bit_ easier by automating usage of Sonatype Nexus so that you don't have to constantly refresh your browser after every operation to check if has gone through yet. 

`startship` will read your library's maven coordinates from `gradle.properties`, find your staged repository, request it to be closed, wait till it's closed, promote it to release, and finally wait till it's synced to maven central. It also tries to be helpful by making sure you don't release an incorrect artifact by comparing maven coordinates and versions.

**Maven coordinates**

Maven coordinates for your artifacts are read from your project's `gradle.properties`.

```properties
GROUP=com.example
POM_ARTIFACT_ID=nicolascage
VERSION_NAME=4.2.0
```

Alternatively, you can provide them using `-c`.
```shell script
# Single artifact:
$ startship release -c com.example:nicolascage:4.2.0

# Multiple artifacts
$ startship release -c com.example:nicolascage,dianekruger:4.2.0
```

**Sonatype credentials**

Sonatype account credentials are read from your machine's `~/gradle/gradle.properties`.
```properties
SONATYPE_NEXUS_USERNAME=username
SONATYPE_NEXUS_PASSWORD=password
```

You can also provide these using `-u` and `-p` options. The values passed can be either Gradle property keys or your actual username or password values.
```shell script
$ startship release -u yourActualUsername -p YOUR_PASSWORD_GRADLE_PROPERTY
```

### Contributing and running locally

Sonatype's endpoints are badly documented and can be really flaky at times, causing `startship` to fail. If you run into issues, please consider [sending a PR](https://github.com/saket/startship/pulls). For your local development, `startship` can be modified to run in mock mode:


```diff
 // AppModule.kt
 val nexus = RealNexus(
-  api = nexusModule.nexusApi,
+  api = MockNexusApi(pom),
   debugMode = debugMode,
-  config = NexusConfig.DEFAULT,
+  config = MOCK_NEXUS_CONFIG,
   scheduler = Schedulers.single()
 )
```

Next, run `startship` using:

```
./run release -c com.example:nicolascage:4.2.0
```

### Releasing
1. Draft a changelog.
2. Run `./gradlew clean distZip` and attach `build/distributions/startship.zip` to a new GitHub release.
3. Update the [homebrew formula](https://github.com/saket/homebrew-repo/blob/master/Formula/startship.rb) with a link to the uploaded `startship.zip` archive. A `sha256` checksum of the archive can be created by running `sha256sum` on the command line.
